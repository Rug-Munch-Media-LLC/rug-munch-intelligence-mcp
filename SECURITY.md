## Security Best Practices for Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets** — API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys go in environment variables only
2. **Use `.env` (gitignored)** for local development credentials
3. **Sign your commits** with GPG (`git config commit.gpgsign true`)
4. **Review your own diffs** before pushing — check for accidental credential exposure
5. **Use branch protection** — all changes to main must go through PR review
6. **Run `git-sync.py --dry-run`** before pushing to verify no secrets are staged

## Our Security Stack

- Pre-commit hooks scan every staged file for secrets
- Pre-push hooks block force pushes and re-scan for secrets
- GitHub Actions CI runs secret scanning on every PR
- Dependabot monitors dependencies for known CVEs
- Production secrets stored in GitHub Secrets vault + environment variables
- Backend .env never committed (in .gitignore)
