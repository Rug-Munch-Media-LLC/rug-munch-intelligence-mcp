"""
Pre-Crime Deployer Reputation — Behavioral fingerprint matching.

Goes beyond "this token IS a scam" to "this deployer's fingerprint
matches known scammers who haven't rugged YET." Predictive risk scoring
based on deployer behavior patterns.

Signals analyzed:
  - First deployment? (new deployers are higher risk)
  - Funded by mixer/tornado? (laundering attempt)
  - Funded by CEX hot wallet? (legitimate)
  - Source code verified? (legitimacy signal)
  - Matches known scammer behavioral fingerprint?
  - Deployment frequency (batch deployer?)
  - Gas patterns (flashbot/MEV bundler?)
  - Contract bytecode similarity to known scams

Returns a 0-100 risk score with human-readable explanation.
