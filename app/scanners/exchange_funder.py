"""
SENTINEL — Exchange-Funded Wallet Detection
==========================================
Identifies wallets funded from known CEX hot wallets.
Professional snipers create 10-50 fresh wallets, fund each from a CEX
to break on-chain link, then consolidate profits back through bridges or DEX swaps.

Key insight: wallets with no prior history whose first tx is a CEX withdrawal,
followed by immediate token purchase, are strong sniper signals.

Uses direct API calls: Solscan (account transfers, funding sources),
Helius (signatures, parsed transactions), Birdeye (token overview).
