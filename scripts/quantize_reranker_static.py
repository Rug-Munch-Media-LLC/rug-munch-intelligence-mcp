"""Static INT8 quantization for bge-reranker-v2-m3 cross-encoder.

Dynamic quantization kept weights as fp32 (2725MB). Static quantization
with calibration data actually reduces weights to INT8 (~500MB).

Uses onnxruntime quantization with representative calibration dataset
of (query, document) pairs covering the tokenizer vocabulary.

Usage: docker exec <container> python3 scripts/quantize_reranker_static.py
