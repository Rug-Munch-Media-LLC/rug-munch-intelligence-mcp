"""
Domain Fine-Tuned Embeddings — MarginMSE with hard negative mining.

Trains scam-specific embeddings that outperform general-purpose models
for crypto security tasks. Uses cross-encoder as teacher, hard negative
mining from retrieval errors, MarginMSE loss for optimization.

Output: Fine-tuned sentence-transformer model saved to /app/data/models/

Usage:
    python3 scripts/finetune_embeddings.py --epochs 3 --batch-size 16

Requirements:
    - Redis with existing RAG documents (for hard negative mining)
    - Cross-encoder model (for teacher scores)
    - Training data: scam queries + positive/negative document pairs
